# EPICODE Full Stack 02 - Final Project

This is the final project of EPICODE's Full Stack Developer bootcamp started on September 2021. 

## Topic

I chose to recreate (part of) The British Museum blog.

### How it is made

The project required the combined use of React and Wordpress: the front-end is built with React which uses the WP Rest API to display the content managed by WordPress.

## Things left to do
* front-end form validation
* add comments functionality (?)
